#  Verify that existing input catalogs are sufficient

Summary -- There exists a comprehensive model of the universe in the current CatSim database. There are, of
course, some limitations (e.g. simple galaxy profiles). This task will document that the Twinkles 1.0
requirements are met.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS5.1.1 ( 09/16 ): Gather requirements from SN and WL working groups.
* Key Task CS5.1.2 ( 09/16 ): Use the validation framework to show that requirements are
being met.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
